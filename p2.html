                The First International Conference on Computer Science, Engineering and Information
                Technology (CCSEIT-2011), The First International Conference on
                Parallel, Distributed Computing Technologies and Applications (PDCTA-2011),
                and The First International Conference on Digital Image Processing and Pattern
                Recognition (DPPR-2011) were held in Tirunelveli - Tamil Nadu, India,
                during September 23â€“25, 2011. The events attracted many local and international
                delegates, presenting a balanced mixture of intellects from all over the
                world. The goal of this conference series is to bring together researchers and
                practitioners from academia and industry to focus on understanding parallel,
                distributed computing technologies, digital image processing and pattern recognition
                and all areas of computer science, information technology, and to establish
                new collaborations in these areas.
                The CCSEIT 2011, PDCTA 2011 and DPPR 2011 committees invited original
                submissions from researchers, scientists, engineers, and students that illustrate
                research results, projects, survey works, and industrial experiences describing
                significant advances in the areas related to the relevant themes and tracks of the
                conferences. This effort guaranteed submissions from an unparalleled number of
                internationally recognized top-level researchers. All the submissions underwent
                a strenuous peer-review process which comprised expert reviewers. Besides the
                members of the Technical Program Committee, external reviewers were invited
                on the basis of their specialization and expertise. The papers were reviewed based
                on their technical content, originality, and clarity. The entire process, which includes
                the submission, review, and acceptance processes, was done electronically.
                All these efforts undertaken by the Organizing and Technical Program Committees
                led to an exciting, rich, and high-quality technical conference program, which
                featured high-impact presentations for all attendees to enjoy and to expand their
                expertise in the latest developments in this field.
                There were a total 1,256 submissions to the conference, and the Technical
                Program Committee selected 185 papers for presentation at the conference and
                subsequent publication in the proceedings. This small introduction would be
                incomplete without expressing our gratitude and thanks to the General and
                Program Chairs, members of the Technical Program Committees, and external
                reviewers for their excellent and diligent work. Thanks to Springer for the strong
                support. Finally, we thank all the authors who contributed to the success of the
                conference.We also sincerely wish that all attendees benefited academically from
                the conference and wish them every success in their research.

                In this section, we will discuss about web server attacks that involves search
                engines to find vulnerable servers and to propagate its attack.
                In July 2004, a variant of MYDOOM worm used SMTP mail service to spread
                and steal email addresses from the address book of target machines [5]. When
                an email address (mail@example.com) is found, the worm uses the domain name
                (example.com) as a query in search engines such as Google, Yahoo, Lycos, and
                AltaVista to find email addresses of that domain in the search result and propagates
                further.
                In December 2004, PhpBB Bulletin Board System, an open source php-based
                web forum application, has been reported with a remote PHP script injection
                and input validation vulnerabilities due to an improper use of urldecode() on
                user-supplied input for highlight parameter in viewtopic.php phpBB script file
                [6]. The urldecode() function, which is used to filter potentially malicious content
                from user-supplied input, failed to properly translate input. Using these
                vulnerabilities, a remote attacker could have executed arbitrary commands on a
                vulnerable server without sufficient privileges, which could have been exploited
                to trigger SQL injection attacks.
                After this issue was posted on the Internet, a Santy.A worm was created to
                exploit these vulnerabilities using the Google search engine as a tool to search for
                the keyword viewtopic.php in order to find the potentially vulnerable servers [7].
                When a victim site was found, the worm would attack the system by exploiting
                the highlight parameter vulnerability in the phpBB software. This worm would
                execute itself by using the PERL environment of the compromised server and
                propagate further. When Google stopped the worm from using its search engine
                for finding the vulnerable sites, variants of the worm (Santy.B) started using
                AOL and Yahoo search engines to locate the vulnerable websites [8]. Thus, if
                one of the several search engines is able to stop a threat, there are several other
                search engines that attackers can use to perform their malicious actions.
                In May 2008, Asprox trojan, a spam botnet for sending phishing emails, with
                Danmec, a password-stealing trojan, searches Google for web servers that use
                asp, aspx, or php scripts to dynamically generate web pages from SQL databases
                [9,10]. With the list of URLs from search engine, it launches SQL-Injection attack
                to inject an iframe into the website source which will redirect visitors of that
                14 K. Murugesan and M. Singhal
                For example, searching index of / can show the list of websites with a directory
                listing enabled. Sometimes, it could be easy to find sensitive files or even system
                password files like /etc/passwd, .htpasswd, sam password files, etc. with this
                search, if the websites have accidently enabled a directory listing. A search for the
                query 500 server error shows a list of vulnerable websites that can provide useful
                information like operating system version, port numbers, sql queries, source code,
                etc. for an attacker. Similarly, a query @yahoo.com reveals a list of yahoo mail
                users, which can be used by a spammer for phishing or advertising. Figure 2
                shows the Google search engine statistics for the above queries.
                4 Search Engine-Based Web Server Attacks
                In this section, we will discuss about web server attacks that involves search

                password files like /etc/passwd, .htpasswd, sam password files, etc. with this
